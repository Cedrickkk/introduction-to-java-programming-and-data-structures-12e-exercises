# Learning Java with Daniel Liang's Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to learning Java through **Daniel Liang's "Introduction to Java
Programming & Data Structures"** textbook! This repository serves as a collection of my solutions, exercises, and notes
as I work through the book.

## 📖 About the Book

Daniel Liang's book is super popular for learning Java, covering everything from the basics to more advanced stuff like
how programs actually work and making graphical interfaces. My goal here is to really understand what the book teaches.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

I've organized everything by chapter to make it easy to find.

```
├── chapter2/ 
│ ├── ComputeChange.java 
│ └── ComputeLoan.java 
├── chapter3/ 
│ ├── casestudy/
│ │    ├── ComputeAndInterpretBMI.java 
│ │	   ├── ...
│ └── Quiz.java 
├── ... 
└── README.md
```

│   └── main/

│       ├── util/ # This directory for general utilities
│       │   └── Reminder.java # Contains hardcoded motivational quotes
│       └── Main.java # The main class to run various utilities or tests
├── .gitignore
├── java-11-test.iml
└── README.md
```

Inside each `chapterXX` folder, you'll find:

- **Listings and Quizzes:** Including `QuizClassname.java` (my answers to chapter quizzes), and `ConceptExamples.java` (
  small code examples to help me grasp key ideas).
- `casestudies/`: A subfolder containing solutions and notes for case study problems.

You'll also find a util/ directory and Main.java directly within src/main, which contain:

- `util/`: A subfolder for general utility classes.
- `Reminder.java`: A class that holds a set of hardcoded motivational quotes to keep me going!
- `Main.java`: A central class to run Reminder class

## ✨ What's Here

- **Solutions to End-of-Chapter Exercises:** My implementations for the programming problems presented in each chapter.
- **Quiz Answers:** Where applicable, my answers to the review questions.
- **Code Examples:** Practical demonstrations of the concepts taught.

This is primarily a personal learning repository. However, if you find any errors in my solutions or have suggestions
for improvements, feel free to open an issue or a pull request!
